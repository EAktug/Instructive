Computer Programs Chapter 7,
2nd edition Heer/Maussner, Dynamic General Equilibrium Modeling
===============================================================

- store all computer programs in the same directory

- if you want to save/load data in/from a different directory,
you need to specify the save/load path in the top of the program

- the programs should run without any other changes

- the program Rh7_func.g needs ch8_toolbox.src as an input file; therefore 
the two programs need to be stored in the same directory
